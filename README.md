## About Give
Give is a personal passion project of mine. Give's goal is to give half of profits to multiple myeloma cancer patients. I was inspired by a roomate of mine who lost his father to multiple myeloma, we created a similar brand that was able to donate thousands of dollars to a multiple myeloma cancer patient.
