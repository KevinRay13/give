## About Give
Give is a personal passion project of mine. Give's goal is to give half of profits to multiple myeloma cancer patients. I was inspired by a roomate of mine who lost his father to multiple myeloma, we created a similar brand that was able to donate thousands of dollars to a multiple myeloma cancer patient.

### Exciting Challenge
Integrating Stripe was an interesting challenge, having Redux pull the items chosen into the shopping cart and utilizing javascript to add up the product values before allowing stripe to take those values was a very rewarding experience. Also worth noting was the process of making it mobile responsive. CSS and the box model are my favorite aspects of front end development, I love seeing a project from a users perspective. Having things come together and seeing my hard work visually manifest is always a sweet moment.
